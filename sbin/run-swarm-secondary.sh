# This install script assumes a Centos7 server is the installation host OS.
# It will download some additional information to build a Docker image for that
# type of host.
#
# Before running, confirm you can run docker commands as this user with
# 'docker info'.  See the README.md file for more information on setup for
# this program and Docker.  You will also need to install the dnsbridge
# program before this one.
